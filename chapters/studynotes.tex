\subsection*{Further reading}

A readable exposition of Popper's ideas about falsification is his essay “Science as falsification”, included in the collection \textit{Conjectures and Refutations} \citep{popper_conjectures_1963}. A discussion of the role of operationalization in the context of corpus-based semantics is found in \citet{glynn_empirical_2010}, \citet{wulff_multifactorial_2003,} is a study of adjective order in English that operationalizes a variety of linguistic constructs in an exemplary and very transparent way. \citet{zaenen_animacy_2004} is an example of a detailed and extensive coding scheme for animacy.

\subsection*{Further reading}

No matter what corpora and concordancing software you work with, you will need regular expressions at some point. Information is easy to find online, I recommend the Wikipedia Page as a starting point \citep{wikipedia_contributors_regular_2018}. An excellent introduction to issues involved in annotating corpora is found in Geoffrey Leech's contribution ``Adding linguistic annotation'' in \citet{wynne_developing_2005}. An insightful case study on working with texts in non-standardized orthographies is found in \citet{barnbrook_language_1996} (which is by now seriously dated in many respects, but still a worthwhile read).


\section*{Study notes to Chapter 5}

(see Study notes to Chapter 6)


\section*{Study notes to Chapter 6}
\label{sec:studynotes06}

\subsection*{Resources}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item A comprehensive and well-maintained statistical software package is R, available for download free of charge from \url{https://www.r-project.org/} for Linux, Mac OS X, Windows.
  \item Especially if you are using Linux or Windows, I also recommend you download R Studio (also free of charge), which provides an advanced user interface to R, \url{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/}.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Further reading}

Anyone serious about using statistics in their research should start with a basic introduction to statistics, and then proceed to an introduction of more advanced methods, preferably one that introduces a statistical software package at the same time. For the first step, I recommend \citet{butler_statistics_1985}, a very solid introduction to statistical concepts and pitfalls specifically aimed at linguists. It is out of print, but the author made it available for free download at \url{https://web.archive.org/web/20060523061748/http://www.uwe.ac.uk/hlss/llas/statistics-in-linguistics/bkindex.shtml}. For the second step, I recommend \citet{gries_statistics_2013} as a package deal geared specifically towards linguistic research questions, but I also encourage you to explore the wide range of free or commercially available books introducing statistics with R.


\section*{Study notes to Chapter 7}
\label{sec:studynotes07}

If you want to learn more about association measures, \citet{evert_statistics_2005} and the companion website at \url{http://www.collocations.de/AM/} are very comprehensive and relatively accessible places to start. \citet{stefanowitsch_corpus-based_2016} discuss corpus-based association measures in the context of psycholinguistics.

\section*{Study notes to Chapter 8}
\label{sec:studynotes08}

\subsection*{Resources}

The Corpus of Late Modern English Texts (CLMET v3.1) is available for download free of charge at \url{https://fedora.clarin-d.uni-saarland.de/clmet/clmet.html}.

\subsection*{Further reading}

Grammar is a complex phenomenon investigated from very different perspectives. This makes general suggestions for further reading difficult. It may be best to start with collections focusing on the corpus-based analysis of grammar, such as \citet{rohdenburg_determinants_2003}, \citet{gries_corpora_2006}, \citet{rohdenburg_one_2009} or \citet{lindquist_corpus_2004}.

\section*{Study notes to Chapter 9}
\label{sec:studynotes09}

\subsection*{Further reading}

For a different proposal of how to \textit{evaluate TTRs statistically}, see \citet[Section 6.5]{baayen_analyzing_2008}; for a very interesting method of comparison for TTRs and HTRs based on permutation testing instead of classical inferential statistics see \citet{saily_comparing_2009}.

\section*{Study notes to Chapter 10}
\label{sec:studynotes10}

\subsection*{Resources}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The Corpus of Historical American English (COHA) is commercially available from Mark Davies at Brigham-Young University, who also provides a free web interface at \url{https://corpus.byu.edu/coha/}.
  \item The n-gram data from the Google Books archive is available for download free of charge at \url{http://storage.googleapis.com/books/ngrams/books/datasetsv2.html} (note that the files are extremely large).
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Further reading}

This chapter has focused on very simple aspects of variation across text types and a very simple notion of “text type”. \citet{biber_variation_1988} and \citet{biber_typology_1989} are good starting points for a more comprehensive corpus-based perspective on text types. As seen in some of the case studies in this chapter, \textit{text} is frequently a proxy for demographic properties of the speakers who have produced it, making corpus linguistics a variant of sociolinguistics, see further \citet{baker_sociolinguistics_2010}.

\section*{Study notes to Chapter 11}
\label{sec:studynotes11}

\subsection*{Further reading}

\citet{deignan_metaphor_2005} is a comprehensive attempt to apply corpus-linguistic methods to a range of theoretically informed research questions concerning metaphor. The contributions in \citet{stefanowitsch_corpus-based_2006} demonstrate a range of methodological approaches by many leading researchers applying corpus methods to the investigation of metaphor.
